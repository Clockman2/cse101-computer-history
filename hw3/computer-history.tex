\section*{ABSTRACT}
\textit{
Today we are used to having many different easy ways of transferring data on drives. Well, It wasn't always as simple. In this paper we will be discussing how HDD's (hard drives) got their start, as well as RAM, (Random Access Memory) which is critical to our computers today.
}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{INTRODUCTION}

The topic we chose was "Memory and Storage," and we chose this topic because it is something we all need and hold as important, but very few of us really think about storage very often. Before HDD's - paper or other writing implements were used, paintings were painted and that was about it. Storage of important data was out of sight and an impossibility. Now, anyone anywhere can store their valuable photos or documents with ease. 

RAM is an important (That might be an understatement, because without RAM your device would never turn on) part of your device. It holds your tabs and other files held in the background.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{TIME PERIOD}

You should describe the time period in which your topic was
invented or used here. Also include the context for why your
topic was created or for how it is used. Any specific historical
information should be included here.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{COMPUTER HARDWARE}

You should list the specification of any hardware your topic
uses here. If you want make a table here, please label the table
and include discussion on what components are included in the
table and why. See Table
\ref{tbl:example} for an example of a table.
The labels/captions of the table should be put at the bottom
of the table.


\begin{table}[h!]
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{||c | c | c | c||} 
\hline
  & Col1 & Col2 & Col3 \\ [0.5ex]
\hline\hline
Row1 & (1,1) & (1,2) & (1,3) \\ 
\hline
Row2 & (2,1) & (2,2) & (2,3) \\
\hline
Row3 & (3,1) & (3,2) & (3,3) \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Example of a table}
\label{tbl:example}
\end{center}
\end{table}

You might want to put figures in the document. Please
remember to label them. The labels/captions of the figures
should be put at the bottom of the figure. See Figure
\ref{fig:example} for an example of how to use figures.
You will need to place the figure in an \texttt{images/} folder
in your working directory.

\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{spiral.png}
\caption{Example of a figure}
\label{fig:example}
\end{figure} 

\section{COMPUTER SOFTWARE}

Describe the software used for your chosen topic if any,
and state any uses of the software that your topic had.
If your topic does not have or use software, describe why it
doesn't use software and how it functions without it.

\section{CONCLUSION}

Conclude your research paper with any reflections on what you
learned about your topic. Was this what you expected to find?
Did you find any facts that surprised you? You may add other
personal reflections about the topic here.
